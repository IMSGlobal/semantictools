abstract= \
  A LineItemContainer defines the endpoint to which clients \n\
  POST new LineItem resources and from which they GET the list of LineItems associated with a \n\
  a given learning context.  This specification document describes a media type suitable for \n\
  the response from a GET request.  The response is based on the W3C Linked Data Platform recommendations. \n\

  A LineItemContainer defines the endpoint to which clients \n\
  POST new LineItem resources and from which they GET the list of LineItems associated with a \n\
  a given learning context.  This specification document describes a media type suitable for \n\
  the response from a GET request.
  
sampleText=\
  <p>The items within a LineItemContainer are paginated in accordance with the W3C Linked Data Platform \n\
  recommendations.  Figure 1 shows one page of items.  It is the responsibility of the server to determine \n\
  the maximum number of items that will be returned in each page. In this example, the number of items is \n\
  artificially limited to just two items.  In a typical, real-world case the number of items per page \n\
  will be larger.  Notice that the payload gives the URI for the next page.  If there is no next page,  \n\
  the <code>nextPage</code> property will have the value "nil".</p>
