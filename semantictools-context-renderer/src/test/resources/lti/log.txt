* Renamed "capability" property of MessageHandler to "enabled_capability"
* Added description of RestService class
* Added description of RestService.format property
* Added description of RestService.action property
* Added description of ProductInfo.product_family property
* Added description of ResourceHandler.message property
* Added description of ResourceHandler.icon_info property
* Added description of ResourceHandler.resource_type property
* Eliminated unused LocalizedTitle class
* Eliminated ToolProxyBindingState class.  This will be reintroduced later when we support 
  state-changed-notification message types.
* Excluded ProductInstance.profile property from application/vnd.ims.lti.v2.ToolConsumerProfile+json 
 
Known Issues:
* The RDF Ontology generated from the Star UML model generates an owl:Restriction for a
  property only if the cardinality of that field is customized within the scope of a particular class.
  This is appropriate from a pure data modeling perspective.  However, it means that class-specific
  descriptions for properties are lost.  Need to update the RDF Ontology generator so that
  these descriptions are preserved.
  
* Should rewrite URLs to be relative, so that local references within the zip file resolve.

* Remove namespace prefix from simple datatype names since the namespace is declared in the JSON-LD context.
