CourseSection.introduction= \
  <p>This specification defines a JSON binding for Course Section objects.              \n\
  The properties of this object are drawn from Common Education Data Standards [CEDS]   \n\
  and the IMS LIS data model [LIS-CMS], plus some custom properties added by            \n\
  Pearson.</p>                                                                          \n\
                                                                                        \n\
  <p>The binding defined in this specification conforms to the JSON-LD conventions      \n\
  [JSON-LD-syntax].  Briefly, JSON-LD adds semantics to a JSON document by              \n\
  associating properties that may appear in a document with well-defined data types     \n\
   through the use of a so-called "context".   It is not necessary to understand the    \n\
   mechanics of JSON-LD to read or write a JSON document that complies with the binding \n\
   defined by this specification.  Indeed, this specification is self-contained         \n\
   in the sense that it provides all the information necessary to define a              \n\
   compliant JSON binding of an OrganizationPersonRole object.  On the other hand, readers \n\
   who have some familiarity with JSON-LD will likely find this specification           \n\
   document easier to digest.</p>
